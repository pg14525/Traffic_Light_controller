ðŸš¦ Traffic Light Controller
This project implements a traffic light controller using hardware description language (HDL), simulating the real-world operation of traffic signals. 
It manages traffic flow through timed state transitions (RED, YELLOW, GREEN) based on preset logic. Designed for FPGA deployment, this project is ideal for learning FSM (Finite State Machine) design, digital logic, and Verilog/VHDL synthesis. It can be extended with features like pedestrian control, sensor inputs, or emergency overrides.

 Developed an FSM-based traffic light controller using Verilog and ModelSim, ensuring seamless state transitions and
 efficient intersectional traffic management.Utilized state diagrams and state tables to plan the FSM effectively.
 
 Designed and implemented six distinct states to manage traffic flow for 4 vehicle paths, incorporating automatic red,
 green, and yellow light transitions based on specified time intervals.
